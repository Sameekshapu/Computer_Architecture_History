MEASURING PERFORMANCE
Performance Observation
ENIAC was to be 1000 times faster than the
Harvard Mark-I
IBM Stretch (7030) was to be 100 times
faster than the fastest computer then in existence.
The original measure of performance was the time required to
perform an individual operation, such as addition.


What is Average instruction execution time?

Time for each instruction * weight in the mix
 

Since instruction sets were similar,
this was a more precise comparison than add times. From average
instruction execution time, then, it was only a small step to MIPS.
MIPS had the virtue of being easy to understand; hence, it grew in
popularity.

THE QUEST FOR AN AVERAGE PROGRAM 

As processors were becoming more sophisticated and relied on
memory hierarchies and pipelining, a single execution time for each instruction no longer existed; neither execution time nor MIPS, therefore, could be calculated from the instruction mix and the manual.

Lets look into the Benchmarks
